How
do I find a restaurant where I can order online?&nbsp;</span><br>

<br>
<span style="color: rgb(208, 44, 48); font-weight: bold;">How
do I cancel an order I have already submitted?</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(112, 112, 112);">To cancel your
order, go to My
Account and select Order History. If the order is able to be canceled,
click the Cancel Order button that is displayed to the right of the
order information. If the order has already been accepted
and/or processed by the location, the Cancel Order button will not be
displayed, and you will need to call the store directly. The location's
phone number can be found on the email receipt of your order as well as
on the website store locator.</span><br>

<br style="color: rgb(112, 112, 112);">
<big><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(99, 101, 106);">Help
with Group Ordering</span></big><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(208, 44, 48); font-weight: bold;">How
does Group Ordering work?</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(112, 112, 112);">A Group Order is
started by one person, the originator.&nbsp; The originator invites
others (invitees) by adding email addresses to a field on the order
invitation screen.&nbsp; The originator will select a payment
option before the invitations to the order are sent.&nbsp; The
originator has the option of paying for the entire order and giving
each individual a preset spending limit, or letting each invitee pay
for their individual order.&nbsp; Each invitee will receive an
email invitation to the order and place their orders according to how
the originator set it up.&nbsp; An invitee can choose to opt out of
the order as well. All orders must be submitted prior to the cutoff
time.&nbsp; The cutoff time is the preset time based on the desired
ready time so that your store has enough time to complete the order.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(208, 44, 48);">How
do I know that the group order has been submitted?&nbsp;</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(112, 112, 112);">Your Group Order
will be sent to the store once the cutoff time has been
reached.&nbsp; Each invitee including the originator will need to
complete and submit their orders prior to the cutoff time. Each invitee
will get an email with a receipt of their order and they will get a
confirmation screen after submitting letting them know the order has
been added to the Group Order.&nbsp; The customer will get a
confirmation email from the location when the order is
accepted.&nbsp; They can check the status of their order under
their account.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(208, 44, 48); font-weight: bold;">Can
invitees be stored for future Group Orders?</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(112, 112, 112);">Yes, invitee
email addresses will be available to the originator for future orders.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(208, 44, 48);">I’m
paying for the entire group order and one of the invitees can’t access
the site from work.&nbsp; Can I enter their order on their behalf?</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(112, 112, 112);">Yes, as the
originator, if you are paying for the entire order you will have the
capability to start or edit an invitees order from the Group Order
screen.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(208, 44, 48); font-weight: bold;">How
do I access the Group Order screen if I exit my web browser?</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(112, 112, 112);">Go back to the
website and log in.&nbsp; You will then go to your account and
click on Group Orders.&nbsp; Click on the group order number you
wish to open.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(208, 44, 48); font-weight: bold;">My
total was $75.&nbsp; Why was I charged $200 on my bank statement?</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(112, 112, 112);">With group orders
the card is pre-authorized for the total amount of all the spending
limits on the order. This charge is a pending charge like at a gas
station and will convert to the proper amount 3 to 5 business days
after the order has been completed by the location depending on the
banking institution being used.</span>
